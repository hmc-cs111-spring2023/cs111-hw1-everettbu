# Language

_Scratch https://scratch.mit.edu/_

# Domain

_Beginner CS student work projects_

# Computational model

_When a program in Scratch is run, an animation is created that used a set of predefined blocks that the user can manipulate. 
These blocks simulate a programming language but have a very limited capacity. For example, one set of the blocks deterimes 
the movement of a cat (step, turn, etc.) while another set of blocks can be used to loop these movements and stop them when desired._

# DSL-ness

_I think that Scratch would align more closely with a general-purpose language than a "pure" DSL. This is due to the fact that
it has depends on loops which likely makes it Turing complete. Also, I found that the line was blurred when researching whether Scratch 
was a DSL or a programming language._

# Internal or external?

_External DSL. When using Scratch, its functions are written in the language unique to Scratch and then are processed by JavaScript._

# Host language

_JavaScript_

# Benefits

_Scratch is incredibly easy to understand which makes it well suited for begginer programmers (my first CS class in high school used Scratch).
It has clearly labeled blocks that piece together which can be used to simulate writing functions without knowing coding syntax._

# Drawbacks

_Scratch simplifies coding to a point where its users lose the ability to code anything complex. It is not useful for anything beyond
teaching begginer coders the fundamental elements of CS. Its usefulness is limited by its ability to create basic animations using a set of
tools that Scratch provides, without the use of anything outside the program._
