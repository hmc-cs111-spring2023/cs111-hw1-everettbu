# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
Anyone who wants to create online generated art.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It is easy to create shapes because you can just type in what you want and it will appear. 
Also, it is easy to generate variations of the same shape with different parameters

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
I found it hard to put the shapes I created exaclty where I wanted. Having to toy with the 
x and y coordinates was a lot more difficult than just dragging and dropping the shapes where I wanted 
them to go.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
I looked at examples from my class mates and art that I found online. I also just played with it for
a while.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_It displays shapes in a given space taking size position and color into account_


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
_I thought the colors I used were interesting, it took me a while to figure out how to achive the
shade of blue I used for the snowman. Also, I found it too hard to change the shape of the tringle, I
only could manipulate its size.
